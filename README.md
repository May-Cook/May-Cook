# May Cook

 Hi I'm May, a Computer Science student at [Royal Holloway University](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/). 

### My Programming Background
Python is the language I have the most experience with, so I use it for a lot of my personal projects. I also have a reasonable amount of Java experience due to needing to use it at university. I also have some experience with JavaScript and am currently learning ReactJS.

I have also have small amounts of experience using a veriety of other languages and tools such as SQL, C, C#, Unity, Delphi and Django.
