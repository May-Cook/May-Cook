### My Programming Background
`Python` is the language I have the most experience with, so I use it for a lot of my personal projects. I also have a reasonable amount of `Java` experience due to needing to use it at university. I also have some experience with `JavaScript` and am currently learning `ReactJS`.

I have also have small amounts of experience using a veriety of other languages and tools such as `SQL`, `Bash`,`C`, `C#`, `Unity`, `Delphi` and `Django`.
